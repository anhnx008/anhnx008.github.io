            <p title="About me">I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a Master in Mechanical Engineering. I currently work as a software test engineer.
                   My career goal is to become automation test engineer and eventually a software developer. I have experiences in with mostly testing desktop applications and writing automated tests 
                   for desktop applications. During school, I took a couple courses that expose me to programming and I've ennjoy them all. That's why I want to learn more and do more with programming.
                   Currently taking a Web Development boot camp at the U of M hoping to learn more about web-base applications. Very excited to learn some back-end database stuff as well.
                   Beside work, I really like traveling. It is also my goal to travel and work remotely someday. This course that I am taking hopefully will open door to more opportunities.</p>                    
            <br>
            <p>I have a cat at home and she just turned one year. We got her when she was a kitten. She loves to bite and scratch her owner, but she can be very adorable at times.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I took her outside to the park a couple days ago when the weather was nice, and that was an interesting experience for her and for me. Let just say will remain an indoor cat for a while.</p>
