                    <p title="About me">I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a Master in Mechanical Engineering. I currently work as a software test engineer.
                    My career goal is to become automation test engineer and eventually a software developer. I have experiences in with mostly testing desktop applications and writing automated tests 
                    for desktop applications. During school, I took a couple courses that expose me to programming and I've ennjoy them all. That's why I want to learn more and do more with programming.
                    Currently taking a Web Development boot camp at the U of M hoping to learn more about web-base applications. Very excited to learn some back-end database stuff as well.
                    Beside work, I really like traveling. It is also my goal to travel and work remotely someday. This course that I am taking hopefully will open door to more opportunities.</p>
