Only two users can play at the same time.
Both players pick either rock, paper or scissors. After the players make their selection, the game will tell them whether a tie occurred or if one player defeated the other.
The game will track each player's wins and losses.
Chat functionality included. No online multiplayer game is complete without having to endure endless taunts and insults from your jerk opponent.
