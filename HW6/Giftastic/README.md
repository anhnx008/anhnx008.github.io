Create an array of strings, each one related to a topic that interests you. Save it to a variable called topics.

Take the topics in this array and create buttons in your HTML.

Try using a loop that appends a button for each string in the array.

When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).


This data is provided by the GIPHY API.
Takes the value from a user input box and adds it into your topics array. Then make a function call that takes each topic in the array remakes the buttons on the page.
